# SubFox
**Seamless integration for Subversion source code control**

Project Managers: David Holden and Dale Zimmer

For Subversion:
* Simplify and automate the enumeration of which files are "versioned" within a project.  Although this sounds simple, most Subversion users learn that accidentally including "extra" files in a project leads to major headaches.  It is unwise to merely take "everything" in a folder.

For Tortoise:
* Automate the encoding and decoding of source files triggered by events (aka hooks).

For Visual FoxPro:
* Interact with Subversion directly from inside the Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
* Fulfill all day-to-day interactions with Subversion via Toolbar and/or the VFP Main Menu.
* Develop with VFP native language to allow developers to "add hooks" for their custom environment whenever needed.
